# Slot-Machine

This program uses images for the slots that are 112 by 112 pixels. If you use a higher or lower resolution, it won't look right.

>>>MAKE SURE YOU HAVE at LEAST PYTHON 2.7.9 AND PYGAME 1.9.1<<<

Download slots.py and Slot Machine.png and make sure that they are in the same folder. Be sure to have at least 7 112x112 pixel images in that same folder. 

If you want to change the images/number of images, you must make sure that the images are numbered 1.png, 2.png, 3.png,...etc. If you use more than or fewer than 7, you must edit the code so the program will register this. To do so, right-click slots.py, click "Edit with IDLE" and then scroll down to the bottom. Then modify the list labled "emotes" to match the number of images that you have.

If you wish to change the text that appears on the top, change the text labelled "self.text" and "self.text2" in the program.

Hope you enjoy!
